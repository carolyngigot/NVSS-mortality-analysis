Use NVSS mortality data to describe COVID-19 deaths by decedent industry and occupation

"NVSS mortality.qmd" downloads CDC NVSS Mortality Multiple Cause Files for 2021 from [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm ](https://www.nber.org/research/data/mortality-data-vital-statistics-nchs-multiple-cause-death-data) 

I've requested data on all complaints to NC OSHA related to COVID-19 safety, filed between January 1, 2020 and April 1, 2023: (1) establishment (name, address, and industry code), (2) alleged violation (complaint date and severity), (3) employer compliance (e.g., satisfactory correction), and (4) NC OSHA's response (e.g., onsite inspection, citation issued).

I'd like to compare complaints by industry and occupation versus mortality by industry and occupation.
